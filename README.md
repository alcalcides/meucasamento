Control of the flow of people in a marriage by visual identification

One of the problems that event planners have at the entrance is the unauthorized entry of people, either because they were not invited, or because they negotiated the password of a guest who can not go or because of related causes. This web computing system seeks to promote a more secure and organized environment through a rigid entry system: each person must identify himself to the doorman with his name, id or badge, the doorman checks on his mobile, notebook or tablet and releases or not the entrance.

Each guest should look to register in advance and keep their registration data with them.

It is the responsibility of the organizers and the creator of the system to check frequently the new registrations, to prevent undue registrations. It is advisable to remove the "Register" page after the last check of entries.

This version is still under development and also aims to be a portal for organizing and publicizing a marriage.
